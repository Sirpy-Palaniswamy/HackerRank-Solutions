#Problem
"""
Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x, y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. 
Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n. 
Here, 0≤i≤x;0≤j≤y;0≤k≤x. Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.
